A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution using multiple substitution alphabets,
which is more secure then mono-alphabetic cipher because a mono-alphabetic cipher is any cipher in
which the letters of the plaintext are mapped to ciphertext letters based on a single alphabet key.
Polyalphabetic cipher uses Vigenere table, but it uses different technics for encryption and decryption as described in paper.
